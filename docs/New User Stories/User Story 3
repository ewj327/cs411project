3. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to narrow my search down based on specific tags so that the app can show me more specific restaurants.
Description: 
The app will delineate restaurants further based on certain metrics. 
For example, it has categories that sort restaurants by the type of food they serve, so that if a user wants only restaurants that serve Chinese food, or Italian food, they can do that. 
An additional way to sort restaurants is by price, so that the user can prioritize cheaper restaurants or more expensive restaurants. 
These tags are built into the appâ€™s database and are not determined/updated by the user. 
If the user tries to sort the restaurants by a specific tag but it fails, they can do the process over again.
