4. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to put restaurants I would like to visit on a wishlist so that I can keep track of the recommendations the app gives me.
Description: 
While browsing restaurants, if the user sees a particular restaurant they would really like to visit, they can place that restaurant on a wishlist. 
Each user has their own wishlist of restaurants that they can maintain. 
While looking at your wishlist, you can see all the restaurants that are on it as well as their info (the type of food they serve, their hours, etc.) 
If you decide you no longer want to visit a restaurant, you can take it off your wishlist. 
If you end up eating at the restaurant, though, you can use a different option to add it to your “history” tab instead. 
If a restaurant is on your wishlist, you can still see it while searching for restaurants as in user cases 2 and 3, as the app reminds you that you have expressed interest in that restaurant. 
If adding a restaurant to the wishlist fails, the user will be prompted to try again.
