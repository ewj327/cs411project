2. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to provide my location so that the application can show me nearby restaurants.
Description: 
The app will have a search function where a user can input their location. 
From there, the app will find top-rated restaurants that are within a specific radius of that location. 
If the user wants to search farther out from that starting location, they can adjust the radius that the app will consider. 
Each restaurant also has certain tags associated with them that the user can use to refine their search further. 
If the search is not successful, due to some database error or because the location the user inputted is not valid, they will have to input a new location.
