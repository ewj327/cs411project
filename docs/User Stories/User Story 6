As a logged-in user, I would like to store a wishlist of places I might not be able to go to right away so that I can visit them in the future.
Description: When the app recommends locations to the user after examining preferences, the user has the choice of either selecting a location to go to it right away or storing it in a “wishlist” if the user might like to visit it later. 
Additionally, when recommending future places to the user, the app will consider the locations in the wishlist and use those locations’ preferences to influence future places to suggest. 
If this process fails, error message will be thrown. The wishlist will not be updated and it will not influence future recommendations.
