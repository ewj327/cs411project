5. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to review and make reflections on the places I visited so that the app can recommend more fitting places in the future.
Description: After a user has visited all of their recommended locations in a given path, the user will be asked to rate each location they visited. (They can also choose not to answer). 
For example, if the recommended places are “bar, movie theater, Italian restaurant”, the user will be asked whether they like and dislike one or more of the places recommended. 
After the user's reflection, the app will store the ratings of each preference in this round of recommendations and weigh the preferences differently. 
The recommendations the user gets next time will be influenced by the stored weights of all preferences. 
That is to say, the app will update the weight of preferences for each round of recommendations.
If this process fails, an error message will be thrown and the user will be prompted to rate a given location again.
