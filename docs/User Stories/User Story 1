1. As a user, I would like to log in to my account so I can access my personal information and preferences. 
Description: Each user should be able to log into their own account with a username and password. 
The app should identify and authenticate each userâ€™s login information. 
If successful, the user is able to access their profile and use the app. 
Also, the user should be able to change the password if they want to, or reset the password with their phone number if they forget the original password. 
From there, the user can change personal information on their profile: for example, a user can change their name on the profile and upload a picture as their personal icon. 
These changes, and any other actions or updates the user makes, should persist between logins of the app. 
If not successful, the app will prompt the user to try and log in again.
