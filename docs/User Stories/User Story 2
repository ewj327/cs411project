2. As a logged-in user, I want to choose and modify my preferences based on provided tags at any time so the app can locate related places.
Description: The app will provide some tags like “movie, theater, concert, gym, live house, museum, restaurant, dessert store…”. 
From the provided tags, the user will be able to pick as many tags as they want to specify their preferences. 
For example, for a restaurant, a user could specify if they want a cheaper location or an expensive one, as well as what kinds of food they are looking for. 
Also, there will be a limited number of negative preference tags like “no alcohol,” which provide initial restrictions for the recommendation algorithm. 
When successful, the app will create a list of places that the user might be interested in based on their preferences. 
If unsuccessful, the user will have to go through choosing their preferences again.
