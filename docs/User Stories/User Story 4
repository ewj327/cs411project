4. As a logged-in user, I want the app to find the shortest path between all the places it has generated for me so I can easily visit each location.
Description: Once the user has picked several locations that they want to visit, they can click on a “Go” button so that the app can recommend a route to visit each location. 
When successful, the app should generate the shortest possible route that gets to all of the locations listed. 
The user should be able to pick whether the route would be by walking or by taking a car (or some other kind of public transportation). 
If the app cannot generate such a path, it should let the user know which location cannot be included in the path and recommend an alternative route without the offending location.
