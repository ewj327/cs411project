Secondary stories for user story 6:
1. I would like to be able to add/delete any preferences in my profile after the initial round of setting preferences to keep my preferences up-to-date. 

2. I wish to see the most saved/visited places by other users so that I can decide to go to a place on my own if it is popular.

3. There will also be a favorite list for each user. 
  Description: The user can store a location they have been to their favorite list, then next time choose this place without “recommendation”. 
  Also, this favorite list will be used for the app to find the popularity of a location and weigh it greater than other places as the initial weight.
